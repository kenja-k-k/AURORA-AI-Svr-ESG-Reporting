Guidelines for CO2 Capture and Storage

1. Facility Monitoring
- Facilities must continuously monitor both emitted and captured CO₂.
- Capture efficiency should remain above 85% for compliance.
- Any anomalies should be flagged for immediate review.

2. Storage Site Requirements
- Preferred storage sites are deep saline aquifers or depleted oil & gas fields.
- Storage integrity must be maintained above 99% to ensure long-term containment.
- Seasonal variations (winter, summer) can affect efficiency and must be accounted for.

3. Reporting Standards
- Facilities should report monthly values for emissions, captured CO₂, and stored CO₂.
- Capture efficiency is calculated as:
    (CO₂ Captured ÷ CO₂ Emitted) × 100
- Storage integrity reflects the percentage of CO₂ successfully stored without leakage.

4. Safety and Anomaly Management
- If anomalies are detected, operations should be reviewed within 7 days.
- Notes should document the cause and corrective action taken.
- Persistent anomalies may require suspension of injection activities.

5. Best Practices
- Optimize capture systems during peak emission seasons.
- Regularly maintain compressors and storage site infrastructure.
- Transparency in reporting improves trust and regulatory compliance.
